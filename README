TestRunner 2.0
http://www.programerror.com/software/testrunner/

Setting up TestRunner:
1. Copy the following files into your project using the same structure:

    run_tests
    tests/_testrunner/testrunner.cfg
    tests/_testrunner/testrunner.py

2. Setup the path your default test application in testrunner.cfg
3. Add tests


Adding a Test:
1. Inside the tests/ directory add a new subdirectory.  The name of this
   subdirectory will serve as the test name.  Names that begin with an
   underscore are ignored unless explicitly supplied on the command line.
2. Within the new test directory, create a 'config' subdirectory.  This
   directory is where configuration files for your test can be placed.
   The entire config directory will be copied to a temporary location
   and will become the working directory when testing the application.
   This directory must exist, however it can be empty if your test
   does not require any configuration files.
3. (optional) Add a 'test_list' file that configures individual test
   options.  To pass command line arguments to your application, set
   the 'args' option in this file.  See the sample configuration file
   for additional options (run ./run_tests --help-test-cfg).
